The goal of this assignment is to **broaden your cloud knowledge** by researching and identifying **equivalent services** in **Amazon Web Services (AWS)** and **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)** for each Azure service we studied. You will then **compare** these services in terms of features, security/compliance capabilities, and pricing.

You will present your findings in **Markdown format** within a **GitHub repository** to simulate real-world documentation practices.
